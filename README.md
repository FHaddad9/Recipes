# Recipe Book

This website is for recording my journey into the world of cooking and baking, as well as developing a website. As I progress, I hope to learn more about many different foods.

## What I plan to do

1. Search for various recipes on the web, or try out recommended dishes I would be interested in.
2. Research the chosen food's ingredients, materials and methods to cook. Once I find this, I will add the recipe to the website.
3. Try out the recipe and hopefully post photos, descriptions and review of how I found the recipe and share my opinions through the website.
4. Update regularly and within some time, hope that the website will build and provide an informative approach to aspiring beginner cooks or bakers.
